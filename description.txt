v 1.2.0
The tesseract mod focuses primarly on the post Moon Lord Game. The mod is small so I recommend playing this with Calamity, as most of the content is currently post Moon Lord. Right now the mod adds:

- The Tesseract (10 Levels).
- New Pylons (dungeon, no biome)
- Zenith Weapons.
- New weapons, items, and buffs.
- Recipes for hard-to-find vanilla items.
- COMPATIBLE WITH CALAMITY!
